# Overview of the analysis:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Well last Summer me and my friend took a trip of our life time to NYC for two full weeks exploring historic landmarks like Central Park , the statue of liberty , and the Empire state building it was a magical experience as we flew home together we looked through our  vacation photos and had a realization . one of the key ingredients to the magic was an unlikely suspect,Citi Bike. me and Kate had biked everywhere which allowed us to really know the city and interact with the people who lived there and who are using bikes for their commutes . A gem of an idea starts to form in my mind .What if I can start a similar bike share business for my hometown of Des Moines lowa. so me and Kate start brainstorming and after few weeks later she calls me that she has a potential investor who might be intersted in providing seed funding to explore a Bike share program in our town ,but we both know that the statictical analyiz is diffrent from NYC so we took some steps to make the dream come true:

-first: we need to know how the Bike share business works in NYC.

-second:we will make a proposal of how this gonna work in Des Moines.

after we finish the research now its time to show the investor our analyiz as a story using Tablleau to show it

# Summary:
-------------------------------------------------
we can notice that the most clients that using this service is from subscribtion users and specificaly in Thursdays for all genders and less compared to the customer rides which is less and more used in weekend especially in saturday by all genders too,and notice that the women ride females more than men and for the range of hours between 6-10 AM and 4-7 PM which would be the usual work hours .
i would suggest adding more analysing to show the most rides in each month not only Augest  and show the areas that we can see more use for the Bike share service as shown below

in here we can show the most rides that happend in Augest
